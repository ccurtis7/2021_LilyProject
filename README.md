# 2021_LilyProject
The goal of our code is to convert images of lily slices
into masks of the petal cross-sections. Also, to take thickness measurements that are tangent to a line that bisects the petal cross section, and measure the distance from end to end. Eventually, this data will be compiled to a graph and compared to an equation in Mahadevan PNAS 2011 that models lily petals.
